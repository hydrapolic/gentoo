Subject: trace: fix build with gcc9
X-Git-Url: https://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=3fd3b266d4198c06e8e421ca515d9ba09ccd5155

trace: fix build with gcc9

While I've not observed this myself, gcc 9 (imo validly) reportedly may
complain

trace.c: In function '__trace_hypercall':
trace.c:826:19: error: taking address of packed member of 'struct <anonymous>' may result in an unaligned pointer value [-Werror=address-of-packed-member]
  826 |     uint32_t *a = d.args;

and the fix is rather simple - remove the __packed attribute. Introduce
a BUILD_BUG_ON() as replacement, for the unlikely case that Xen might
get ported to an architecture where array alignment higher that that of
its elements.
